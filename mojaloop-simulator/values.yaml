# Default values for mojaloop-simulator.
# This is a YAML-formatted file.
# Declare variables to be passed into your templates.

# Usage:
# Add simulators to the simulators object. The following example will create two simulators,
# 'payerfsp' and 'payeefsp' that will be created with the default values available lower in this
# file.
#
# simulators:
#   payerfsp: {}
#   payeefsp: {}
#
# The default values can be overridden for all sims by modifying mojaloop-simulator.defaults in
# your parent chart. They can also be overriden per-simulator. The following example will result in
# a payerfsp without a cache and a payeefsp with a cache.
#
# simulators:
#   payerfsp:
#     config:
#       cache:
#         enabled: false
#   payeefsp: {}

# TODO & notes:
# * do the port _numbers_ matter at all? Can we get rid of them?
# * for Mowali, how are JWS and TLS secrets being set up?
# * support arbitrary init containers + config (that might just be config that goes into defaults
#   or something?). Supply all config and volumes to the init containers.
# * create some test containers
# * parametrise imagePullSecretName (global? like https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/redis#parameters)
# * generate JWS private/public keys, so the user does not need to supply keys at all.
# * generate public key from private, so the user only needs to supply private keys for each sim?
#   (_might_ be possible with a job or init container or similar).
# * support mTLS auto-cert generation
# * probably eliminate all config that shouldn't actually be changed by a user, e.g.
#   JWS_VERIFICATION_KEYS_DIRECTORY. That's a good configuration option to have for other contexts,
#   such as running the sim locally or in docker-compose but in this context it's _an
#   implementation detail_. The chart user should not have to worry about it, and we should not
#   have to test the effect of changing it.
#   Also
#   INBOUND_LISTEN_PORT
#   OUTBOUND_LISTEN_PORT
# * make ingress more generic- do not preconfigure annotations
# * think about labels a little more carefully- the app should probably always be "mojaloop-simulator"
# * add config map and hashes to the deployments so that a configmap change triggers a rolling
#   update
# * support JWS public keys for other entities. Add a note in the documentation that they must map
#   directly to the value that will be received in the FSPIOP-Source (check this is correct)
# * update labels to be compliant. E.g. app.kubernetes.io/name or whatever
# * rename ".Values.defaults.config" as it's pretty a useless name
# * support arbitrary sidecars?
# * use the redis subchart? https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/redis
#   - this would mean a single instance of redis (probably good)
#   - might need to have the simulators use separate databases per simulator, or prefix all of
#     their keys with their own name, or something
# * allow the user to optionally specify the namespace, with the caveat that that namespace will
#   need to be created manually before the release is deployed. There may be a horrible hack (which
#   I have not tried) whereby all templates are moved to a different directory, say ./xtemplates,
#   then all are imported using {{ .Files.Glob }} and {{ .Files.Get }} then templated into a single
#   amazing template with {{ template }}. At the top of this template goes a namespace. The
#   consequence of this is that the namespace is created first, enabling this beautiful pattern.
#   Remember, with great power comes great responsibility. (In other words, we probably have a
#   responsibility to _not_ do this).
# * should redis be a statefulset? optionally? what does the bitnami chart do?
# * move labels into helpers
# * autogenerate ILP stuff?
# * defaults.resources looks like it's used nowhere- check this and remove it as appropriate
# * look for references to replicaCount in the charts/values. Is it set, or whatever?
# * scale Redis
# * changing JWS_SIGNING_KEY_PATH currently breaks the chart because it's nastily hard-coded. It
#   should be possible to use the Spring filepath functions to avoid this. Similarly, changing
#   RULES_FILE will have a similar effect. Alternatively, make these unconfigured by default. I.e.
#   comment them out, hard-code them and add a warning to the user in the config. (Is there a
#   scenario where the user should want to configure them? I don't think so..).
#   (https://masterminds.github.io/sprig/paths.html)
# * put sim inbound API on port 80
# * supply more documentation, especially a range of examples, and preferably documentation that is
#   executable
# * share configmaps, secrets with init containers
# * share an emptyDir volume between init containers and main containers
# * allow init containers to create secrets and put them on persistent volumes, or emptyDirs, then
#   allow main containers to access those
# * do not put environment variables in configmaps, instead put them straight into the deployments.
#   This makes the deployment much easier to manage.
# * Remember, labels are _for_ identifying stuff. So labels should probably be like "release"
#   (.Release.Name or similar) "chart" (.Chart.Name or similar) "simulator" (e.g. payerfsp,
#   payeefsp) "sim-component" (e.g. backend, scheme-adapter, cache)
# * can _probably_ remove port numbers from services to simplify chart (although perhaps not? try
#   to port-forward with a named port instead of a numbered port?)
