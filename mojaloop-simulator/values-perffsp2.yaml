# The below example assumes your switch will use `FSPIOP-Source: switch`. If instead, for example,
# your switch is using `FSPIOP-Source: peter` you will need a property `peter` in the following

    #       # In order to enable TLS with your supplied credentials, you will need to:
    #       # 1. set all three of the `cert`, `key`, `cacert` fields appropriately for each of
    #       # `inbound` and `outbound` as per your preference.
    #       # 2. optionally specify `schemeAdapter.env.INBOUND_MUTUAL_TLS_ENABLED: true`
    #       # 3. optionally specify `schemeAdapter.env.OUTBOUND_MUTUAL_TLS_ENABLED: true`
    #       # It probably makes sense to set your CA cert in defaults. Note that the default is that
    #       # the CA, cert and key will be generated for you by this chart. To use this functionality
    #       # you only need specify the config documented in steps (2, 3, 4) a few lines up.
