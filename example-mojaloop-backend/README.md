# Example Mojaloop Backend

| Note: This is Helm Wrapper chart should be used purely as an example to deploy External Backend dependencies for Mojaloop for local developer and PoC environments.
| It is strongly recommended that all External Backend Dependencies should be deployed independently, and managed as such with regard to their maintenance (i.e. upgrades, etc)
