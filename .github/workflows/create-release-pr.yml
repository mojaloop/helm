# NOTES:
# - GitHub Actions must be explicitly allowed to create pull requests in this repository. 
#   This setting can be found in the repository's settings under Actions > General > Workflow permissions. 
# - A repository secret `AUTO_RELEASE_TOKEN` (permissions: `contents: write`, `pull-requests: write`, `repositories: read`) needs to be created. 
#   The secret should contain a github access token with the permissions specified above.
#   The secret is used by the `create-pull-request` action to create the pull request and `updatecli` to access all updateable repositories.
#   The secret can be created at https://github.com/mojaloop/helm/settings/secrets/actions
